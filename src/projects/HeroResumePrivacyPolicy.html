      <h1>Privacy Policy for HeroResume</h1>
      <p class="updated">Last Updated: 17th October 2024</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to HeroResume. We are committed to protecting your privacy and
        ensuring you have a positive experience while using our mobile
        application. This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how
        we handle your information.

      <h2>No Data Collection</h2>
      <p>
        At HeroResume, we prioritize your privacy. We want to assure you that:
      </p>
      <ul>

        <li>We do not track your usage of the App.</li>
        <li>We do not store any of your data on our servers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How the App Works</h2>
      <p>HeroResume is designed to function entirely on your device:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          All resume and cover letter content you create is stored locally on
          your device.
        </li>
        <li>Any documents you generate are saved only on your device.</li>
        <li>

        Since we don't collect or store any of your data, there's no need for
        processes to review, update, or delete your information. All your data
        remains under your control on your device.
      </p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        While we don't collect your data, we encourage you to take steps to
        protect the information on your device, such as using device passwords
        and keeping your operating system up to date.
